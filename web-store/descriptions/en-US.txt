Main modules:

🎬 Player enhancements
Quality lock: Automatically switch to your chosen resolution on each playback (e.g., 1080p/720p), falling back to the closest lower quality if unavailable.
Extra speed buttons: Show additional playback speed buttons (e.g., 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x, etc.).
Remember speed per channel: Save speed preferences separately for each channel.
Hide specific buttons: Hide almost any player button as needed for a cleaner UI.
Transparent end screen: Hide blurred recommendations at the end of videos (often suggested videos or creator prompts).
Volume boost: Disable loudness normalization for a true 100% at max volume.

Comment enhancements: Auto-expand long comments and auto-translate comment text.

🧹 Other features
Home layout control: Lock the number of recommended videos per row on the home feed for a consistent grid.
